\begin{abstract}
Knowledge is power - Personal Informatics is a class of systems which aim to use personal data to improve self-knowledge. These systems are commonly designed for specific tasks, using sensors to offload the effort from the user to the system. We suggest exploring a new strategy: self-logging equipment that is inexpensive, multi-purpose, and embeddable. By creating a tool with a generic interface, we enable people to have more control and customization than traditional systems while still alleviating the user’s workload. We propose I/O Bits - simple modules with physical interaction components and an e-paper display that individuals can use to manually track a wide variety of activities and phenomena throughout their daily lives. The display show visualizations of the user’s data to support reflection and insights during tracking. The modules are small and low-power, allowing them to be integrated into a diverse range of everyday environments, supporting spontaneous, flexible, and user-driven tracking that is not restricted by sensors or mobile devices.

\section{Introduction}
Personal Informatics systems help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge [4]. Self-logging technology has become very popular in recent years, with the sector estimated to hit 7 billion dollars by 2024 in the US alone [1]. A majority of <these systems || self-logging tools> (the ones that help users collect data…) utilize sensors to reduce the workload on users. As a result, the sensor-based systems often have a specific purpose and make it difficult for users to customize what data counts. <You have a reference that talks about the importance of customization/story telling/and the distrust in sensors – maybe use that here>. Examples of these systems include: Fitbit for fitness[], Mint for finances[], and Strava[] for location. An alternative approach these systems often take when sensing is too complex is to integrate user-driven logging systems into multi-purpose mobile devices, such as cellphones. Examples of this type of system include: time logging apps like Toggl[], calorie counters such as MyFitnessPal[], and mood trackers such as Happiness[].

While the first approach is successful in reducing the load on the user, it is also limiting. Each device is specifically designed for particular tasks and give users little flexibility to track other activities. The second approach is usually inexpensive and allows for a wider breadth of data types to be collected. As they are seamlessly integrated into a user’s <existing technology ||life>, they are easy to forget and therefore easy to abandon <You have a citation sating that when people start missing data collection moments they abandon – use it here> Additionally, these systems are often cumbersome to interact with while engaged in an activity, making them inconvenient. <Do you have a citation?>

We want to propose a third approach that focuses on collecting a wide variety of data types, facilitates user customization, while reducing the workload of the user (as compared to low tech solutions such as pen and paper), and keeping costs low. While this approach will not be without its own set of drawbacks, we believe it fills a gap left by the other two approaches.

I/O Bits will not replace sensor-based logging, but they will allow for a more diverse exploration of personal data without requiring the time and resources to create automated systems. This effort aims to support more ubiquotious user-driven logging while reducing the overeall burden on users.Iobits don’t replace the above approaches to personal informatics systems (you arnt going to hit a button for every step you take – or carry around a dozen to capture several different types of data) – often the mobile based user driven logging involves the need to type – which iobits cant do…

To study this approach we have designed I/O Bits, cheap, low-power tracking and visualization tools that can be embedded in a variety of physical environments.  We imagine a (very near) future in which it’s possible to have dedicated, lightweight, inexpensive, persistent, and networked tracking and visualization tools available anywhere you want them.

The specific design of I/O Bits also provides solutions to two major issues with personal informatics systems: abandonment and security. 

Research has shown that people abandon devices for a variety of reasons, not all of which are bad [1, 3, 4]. Often people abandon tracking because they have gained the insights they need, have successfully created a habit, or have deemed their tracking not worth the effort. Regardless of the reason, most people abandon tracking within the first 6 months [1, 6]. For most self-logging tools this is the end of their life. However, because I/O Bits are generic they are <not only able to be used concurrently to track a wide variety of data, each device is> also reusable. Each device can be repurposed repeatedly, allowing users to abandon tracking tasks they no longer find useful and start tracking new activities with little new investment.

In our system a data point is logged when a user presses a physical button on the I/O Bit, because there are no sensors the data collect is relatively simplistic. The simplicity of the data collected and the generic nature of our system means that without context – an adversarial could gain access to our data – but privacy would be maintained.


\subsubsection{Text styles}
The \LaTeX\ template facilitates text formatting for normal (for body
text); heading 1, heading 2, heading 3; bullet list; numbered list;
caption; annotation (for notes in the narrow left margin); and
references (for bibliographic entries). Additionally, here is an
example of footnoted\footnote{Use footnotes sparingly, if at all.}
text. As stated in the footnote, footnotes should rarely be used.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Table captions should be placed above the table. We
    recommend table lines be 1 point, 25\% black. Minimize use of
    table grid lines.}
  \label{tab:table1}
  \begin{tabular}{l r r r}
%     \toprule
    & & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\small{\textbf{Test Conditions}}} \\
    \cmidrule(r){3-4}
    {\small\textit{Name}}
    & {\small \textit{First}}
      & {\small \textit{Second}}
    & {\small \textit{Final}} \\
    \midrule
    Marsden & 223.0 & 44 & 432,321 \\
    Nass & 22.2 & 16 & 234,333 \\
    Borriello & 22.9 & 11 & 93,123 \\
    Karat & 34.9 & 2200 & 103,322 \\
     \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Language, style, and content}
The written and spoken language of SIGCHI is English. Spelling and
punctuation may use any dialect of English (e.g., British, Canadian,
US, etc.) provided this is done consistently. Hyphenation is
optional. To ensure suitability for an international audience, please
pay attention to the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Write in a straightforward style. Use simple sentence
  structure. Try to avoid long sentences and complex sentence
  structures. Use semicolons carefully.
\item Use common and basic vocabulary (e.g., use the word ``unusual''
  rather than the word ``arcane'').
\item Briefly define or explain all technical terms. The terminology
  common to your practice/discipline may be different in other design
  practices/disciplines.
\item Spell out all acronyms the first time they are used in your
  text. For example, ``World Wide Web (WWW)''.
\item Explain local references (e.g., not everyone knows all city
  names in a particular country).
\item Explain ``insider'' comments. Ensure that your whole audience
  understands any reference whose meaning you do not describe (e.g.,
  do not assume that everyone has used a Macintosh or a particular
  application).
\item Explain colloquial language and puns. Understanding phrases like
  ``red herring'' requires a cultural knowledge of English. Humor and
  irony are difficult to translate.
\item Use unambiguous forms for culturally localized concepts, such as
  times, dates, currencies, and numbers (e.g., ``1-5- 97'' or
  ``5/1/97'' may mean 5 January or 1 May, and ``seven o'clock'' may
  mean 7:00 am or 19:00). For currencies, indicate equivalences:
  ``Participants were paid {\fontfamily{txr}\selectfont \textwon}
  25,000, or roughly US \$22.''
\item Be careful with the use of gender-specific pronouns (he, she)
  and other gender-specific words (chairman, manpower,
  man-months). Use inclusive language (e.g., she or he, they, chair,
  staff, staff-hours, person-years) that is gender-neutral. If
  necessary, you may be able to use ``he'' and ``she'' in alternating
  sentences, so that the two genders occur equally
  often~\cite{Schwartz:1995:GBF}.
\item If possible, use the full (extended) alphabetic character set
  for names of persons, institutions, and places (e.g.,
  Gr{\o}nb{\ae}k, Lafreni\'ere, S\'anchez, Nguy{\~{\^{e}}}n,
  Universit{\"a}t, Wei{\ss}enbach, Z{\"u}llighoven, \r{A}rhus, etc.).
  These characters are already included in most versions and variants
  of Times, Helvetica, and Arial fonts.
\end{itemize}

      of tesselated cats}
    \caption{In this image, the cats are tessellated within a square
      frame. Images should also have captions and be within the
      boundaries of the sidebar on page~\pageref{bar:sidebar}. Photo:

    \label{fig:marginfig}
\end{marginfigure}

\section{Figures}
The examples on this and following pages should help you get a feel
for how screen-shots and other figures should be placed in the
template. Your document may use color figures (see
Figures~\ref{fig:sample}), which are included in the page limit; the
figures must be usable when printed in black and white. You can use
the \texttt{marginfigure} environment to insert figures in the (left) margin
of the document (see Figure~\ref{fig:marginfig}). Finally, be sure to
make images large enough so the important details are legible and
clear (see Figure~\ref{fig:map}).

\begin{figure*}
  \includegraphics[width=\fulltextwidth]{map}\Description{A world map}
  \caption{In this image, the map maximizes use of space.
    Note that \LaTeX\ tends to render large figures on a
    dedicated page. Image: \ccbynd~ayman on Flickr.}~\label{fig:map}
\end{figure*}


\section{Tables}


\begin{margintable}
    \caption{A simple narrow table in the left margin
      space.}
    \label{tab:table2}
    \begin{tabular}{r r l}
      & {\small \textbf{First}}
      & {\small \textbf{Location}} \\
      \toprule
      Child & 22.5 & Melbourne \\
      Adult & 22.0 & Bogot\'a \\
      \midrule
      Gene & 22.0 & Palo Alto \\
      John & 34.5 & Minneapolis \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{margintable}

You man use tables inline with the text (see Table~\ref{tab:table1})
or within the margin as shown in Table~\ref{tab:table2}. Try to
minimize the use of lines (especially vertical lines). \LaTeX\ will
set the table font and captions sizes correctly; the latter must
remain unchanged.

\section{Accessibility}
The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI
conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and
educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors
are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their
submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the
following five steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add alternative text to all figures
\item Mark table headings
\item Generate a tagged PDF
\item Verify the default language
\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
\end{itemize}

For links to instructions and resources, please see:
\url{http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility}

Unfortunately good tools do not yet exist to create tagged PDF files
from Latex (see the ongoing effort at
\url{http://tug.org/twg/accessibility/}). \LaTeX\ users will need to
carry out all of the above steps in the PDF directly using Adobe
Acrobat, after the PDF has been generated.

For more information and links to instructions and resources, please
see:
\url{http://chi2016.acm.org/accessibility} and
\url{http://tug.org/twg/accessibility/}.


\section{Producing and Testing PDF Files}

We recommend that you produce a PDF version of your submission well
before the final deadline. Your PDF file must be ACM DL Compliant and
meet stated requirements,
\url{http://www.sheridanprinting.com/sigchi/ACM-SIG-distilling-settings.htm}.

\begin{sidebar}
  So long as you don't type outside the right
  margin or bleed into the gutter, it's okay to put annotations over
  here on the left. You may need to have
  to manually align the margin paragraphs to your \LaTeX\ floats using
  the \texttt{{\textbackslash}vspace{}} command.
\end{sidebar}


Test your PDF file by viewing or printing it with the same software we
will use when we receive it, Adobe Acrobat Reader Version 10. This is
widely available at no cost. Note that most reviewers will use a North
American/European version of Acrobat reader, so please check your PDF
accordingly.

\begin{acks}
  We thank all the volunteers, publications support, staff, and
  authors who wrote and provided helpful comments on previous versions
  of this document. As well authors 1, 2, and 3 gratefully acknowledge
  the grant from \grantsponsor{001}{NSF}{}
  (\#\grantnum{001}{1234-2222-ABC}). Author 4 for example may want to
  acknowledge a supervisor/manager from their original employer. This
  whole paragraph is just for example. Some of the references cited in
  this paper are included for illustrative purposes only.
\end{acks}

\section{References Format}

Your references should be published materials accessible to the
public. Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are
easily accessible and may be obtained by any reader for a nominal fee.
Proprietary information may not be cited. Private communications
should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced (e.g.,
[Golovchinsky, personal communication]). References must be the same
font size as other body text. References should be in alphabetical
order by last name of first author. Use a numbered list of references
at the end of the article, ordered alphabetically by last name of
first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets. For papers from
conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and the name of
the conference. Do not include the location of the conference or the
exact date; do include the page numbers if available.

References should be in ACM citation format:
\url{http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style}.  This
includes citations to Internet
resources~\cite{CHINOSAUR:venue,cavender:writing,psy:gangnam}
according to ACM format, although it is often appropriate to include
URLs directly in the text, as above. Example reference formatting for
individual journal articles~\cite{ethics}, articles in conference
proceedings~\cite{Klemmer:2002:WSC:503376.503378},
books~\cite{Schwartz:1995:GBF}, theses~\cite{sutherland:sketchpad},
book chapters~\cite{winner:politics}, an entire journal
issue~\cite{kaye:puc},
websites~\cite{acm_categories,cavender:writing},
tweets~\cite{CHINOSAUR:venue}, patents~\cite{heilig:sensorama},
games~\cite{supermetroid:snes}, and
online videos~\cite{psy:gangnam} is given here.  See the examples of
citations at the end of this document and in the accompanying
\texttt{BibTeX} document. This formatting is a edited version of the
format automatically generated by the ACM Digital Library
(\url{http://dl.acm.org}) as ``ACM Ref''. DOI and/or URL links are
optional but encouraged as are full first names. Note that the
Hyperlink style used throughout this document uses blue links;
however, URLs in the references section may optionally appear in
black.
